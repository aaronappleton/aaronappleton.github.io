<p>This body of work is intended for people who have started programming, but aren&#39;t quite sure how to get from beginner to intermediate.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve probably already gotten the hang of procedural programming: stuff like <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, and basic data types. You&#39;ve also probably been exposed to functions and objects at least once, but maybe you haven&#39;t quite gotten the hang of that yet.</p>

<p>Maybe you also still don&#39;t feel comfortable making a whole new program from scratch, and instead rely on finding examples to jump off of. This series of tutorials and lessons is made to help you think about the structure of and logic of a program, so it doesn&#39;t feel so intimidating when you dive into the code.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve gotten into creative code, you&#39;re also pretty familiar with p5.js. If you&#39;ve used p5, Processing, or openFrameworks, you&#39;ll feel right at home here. If you think you need a refresher, check out <a href="http://hello.p5js.org/">Hello p5</a> to get started. There&#39;s also a lot of great tutorials on getting started over at <a href="http://thecodingtrain.com/">The Coding Train</a></p></div><a href="pong/index">PONG TUTORIAL</a></div></body><div id="footer"><p>Copyright (c) Andrew Cotter</p></div></html>
