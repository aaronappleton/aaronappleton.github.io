While working as a Creative Technologist at [Local Projects](https://localprojects.com/work/ABB), the team worked with philanthropist Ann Friedman and her team to transform the Franklin School, a National Historical Landmark, located six blocks from the White House into Planet Word, the world's first voice-activated museum of language. Through ten immersive learning galleries, visitors can use their voices to interact and engage with exhibits while hearing from a diverse international cast of leaders, authors, and everyday people who share what language means to them.
