[The Wishing Forest](https://redpaperheart.com/work/thewishingforest) is a series of installations that are playful twists of classic holiday trees. Whether it’s a tree that is lit up with 25,000 individually addressable LEDs that react to an ornament flying through pneumatic tubes, or a 30 foot bell that creates a symphony of chimes triggered by body movement - these are holiday displays that you can interact and create with. We invite you to try forest groves inspired by the mechanical magic of classic coin op arcades and music boxes; to make your own memories in crafted sets; and to create your own forest scape with trees that analyze the rhythmic properties of your voice. This holiday, don’t just walk by holiday displays: run through them, talk like a forest animal, light up the trees, and ring a thousand bells at once.
