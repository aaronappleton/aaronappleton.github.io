For my MFA thesis at Parsons, I focused of methods of teaching programming outside of the context of engineering. I specifically focused on a pedagogical practice call the Model-First Approach. The model first approach is focused on showing a student how a system works wholistically before focusing in on the particular aspects of that system. My research manifested as a short series of tutorials focused on serving people who have started to understand the basics of programming, but aren't yet confident enough to dive into more advanced concepts.<br><br>
In my senior fall semester, I made a prototype wearable that used a jumper wire as a sensor. The prototype itself only proved to be a capacitive sensor, but it helped me get used to using the Lilypad microcontroller as the conduit of my design. In the spring, I reverse-engineered an existing EMF sensor to have a qualitative output and mapped that output onto a coat.<br><br>
By letting the user visualize electro-magnetic radiation, this wearable technology helps to better understand the hidden nature of electronic objects.<br><br>
