For my MFA thesis at Parsons, I focused of methods of teaching programming outside of the context of engineering. I specifically focused on a pedagogical practice call the Model-First Approach. The model first approach is focused on showing a student how a system works wholistically before focusing in on the particular aspects of that system. My research manifested as a short series of tutorials focused on serving people who have started to understand the basics of programming, but aren't yet confident enough to dive into more advanced concepts.<br><br>
