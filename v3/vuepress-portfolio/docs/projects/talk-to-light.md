This project was done while I was interning at [Red Paper Heart](https://redpaperheart.com/work/talktolight). We teamed up with some friends at Google to design an open source art installation that would showcase the potential of the technology from Red Paper Heart’s unique point of view and inspire developers and makers everywhere to build things using Custom Device Actions.
