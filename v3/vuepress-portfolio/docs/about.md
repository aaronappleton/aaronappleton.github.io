Hello! I'm Aaron, a learning experience designer working in London. I make interactive experiences that are surprising, fun, and honest.
:::

Iâ€™m wild about designing multisensory learning experiences that blend digital and physical worlds. Whether working on a project that lives in the palm of your hand, takes over a city block, or transforms a classroom, I aim to create playful experiences that ignite curiosity, invite emotional engagement, and lead to deeply meaningful learning.
<br><br>
For my day job, I'm currently freelancing as a Creative Coder for various immersive design agencies in the NYC area. I also teach graduate-level courses at schools like Parsons, usually teaching students how to make art, games, and installations with code. When I'm not coding for money, I'm also involved with LiveCode.NYC, a collective of tech artist who use live programming to create audio-visual performances.
